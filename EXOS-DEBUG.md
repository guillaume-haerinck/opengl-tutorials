> Learn to get OpenGL errors when calling functions

### ü§î The problem

If you made a mistake when calling OpenGL, you currently won't know why and when.

### üßê What is available ?

OpenGL does generate error messages if the paramaters of a function call do not match the ones allowed by OpenGL, or if a function does not interact reasonably with the currently bound context.

These errors are stored in a queue until they are handled by the developer. 

This means that if you do not check for errors between each OpenGL function call, then you won't know from which function the error came from.

### üëå The concrete solution

Wrap each call made to OpenGL inside a macro which will ask OpenGL for errors. If there is any, trigger a breakpoint and output the line and the error on the command line.

```C++
#define BreakAssert(x) if (!x) { debug_break(); assert(false); }

#define GLCall(x) glexp::clear(); x; BreakAssert(glexp::doesFunctionWorks(#x, __FILE__, __LINE__))

namespace glexp {
    /**
     * @brief Empty the OpenGl error buffer
     */
    void clear();

    /**
     * @brief Print OpenGl errors to the console if any
     * 
     * @param functionName
     * @param filename
     * @param line
     */
    bool doesFunctionWorks(const char* functionName, const char* filename, int line);
}

(...)

GLCall(glXXX(myParams));
```

### üí™ The exercice

Modify the `CMakeLists.txt` at the line 12 with `file(GLOB_RECURSE MY_SOURCES src/debug-01/*)`

Then open the `debug-01/main.cpp` and include ` "common/gl-exception.h"`. 

Now you can wrap you OpenGL calls with GLCall, and debug the errors in the file. Try it by yourself. If you get stuck, the correction is below.

<details><summary>Correction</summary>

There were 2 mistakes to find :

- line 24, 25, 26 : GL_FRAMEBUFFER to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER 
- line 31 :  glGenVertexArrays(0, &vao); to  glGenVertexArrays(1, &vao);

</details>

If, even with the correction, you can't make it, go check `cheat/debug-01/main.cpp`.
